# WorkingScopes

WorkingScopes.jl has no utility; it is merely a package of working examples for demonstration and experiments to understand [Scope of Variables](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables-and-scoping/#scope-of-variables) as well as [Metaprogramming](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/) in julia programming.
